# AoC 2022
![CI](https://github.com/andrewrlee/aoc2022/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

with a JFDI attitude, I just want to taste to those sweet, sweet stars.

Currently using node/typescript.

## Running

use `npm test` to run all tests

use e.g: `npm start -- day01` to run jest in watch mode for a single days solution

# Scaffolding

use `npm run add-day` to add files for a new days challenge

To download input automatically as part of the scaffolding, add a `.env` file with a `SESSION` key. 
The `SESSION` value can be obtained via the aoc websites cookies.
